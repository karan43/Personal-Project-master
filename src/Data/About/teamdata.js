    "description":"Nowadays, machine learning is an integral part of almost all systems. Ability to extract information from textual sparse data is vital for an intelligent/data driven system. I am interested in designing Unsupervised and Supervised learning algorithms as well as applying these to various problems related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), especially in south asian languages.I have extensive knowledge in the field of Nepalese language and data computation, data preparation and IR system evaluation in Nepali domain (Devanagari).I am also interested in designing the software vulnerability test and analysis of systems, data integrity and security system that handles the large scale electronic data.",
