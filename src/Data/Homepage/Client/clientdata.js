Since then, the paper has striven to keep the public updated on current affairs, stir discussion and protect democratic values, including human rights and the rule of law. It is the go-to source for credible news, features and critical analysis. With a daily readership of 2.88 million Nepalis, Kantipur is the largest and the most influential daily in the country.Since April 1993, the paper has been publishing a Saturday special called ‘Koseli’, in which readers can find feature articles, short stories, poetry and book reviews. Another weekend adjunct, ‘Kopila’ (first out in March 2001) focuses on stories about children for children. It tries to enhance children’s reading ability and creativity, and on increasing their access to information. The latest special feature to be incorporated is 'Hello Shukrabar' (since 2008), which tries to satiate the hunger for information of the young demographic.`,
