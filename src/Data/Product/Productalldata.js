    "title": "DOCUMENT ARCHIVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DAMS)",
    "subheader":"Client: Prime Minister Office",
    "description1":`Archiving is a necessity within any successful organization, but lack of proper guidance and the domain knowledge it may lead to the improper methods of document storage. We realized that aggregating, structuring, and visualizing the documents/data was a poorly addressed problem in the organizational IT landscape. Integrated ICT Pvt. Ltd. is continuously working on reforming the platform which offers an intelligent capture solution that automates document management processes such as digital archiving and provides a powerful, multi-purpose interface, which can plug into any document storage system you currently have in place.`,
    "description2":`The document archive management project is the approach for creating digital surrogates of documents for facilitating aggregated storage, access and retrieval. The scanned image is passed through processing pipeline where series of operations are performed in the image for the efficient storage and retrieval. Image along with its Meta data and other field parameters are indexed which will eventually help in efficient and flexible searching and retrieval. Optical character recognition (OCR) is performed in the pipeline, which significantly reduces the annotation time for the document.
    Document Archive Management System improves organizational effectiveness by providing companies with greater ability to manage their unstructured information. It also enhances an organizationâ€™s ability to leverage information stores by allowing enterprise wide access for multiple users. Provides security, ensuring that only people authorized to review or edit a document have access to it.`,
